<h2> Why did I make this? </h2>

  For my INST 1550 Class (99 Problems), I was tasked with finding a problem, and creating a viable solution for the problem. The problem I wanted to tackle was racism. Racism is a prominent problem in America that affects everyone and almost every part of someone's life. A big cause of the problem is that not enough people are educated about other ethnic groups and races, which has led to systematic discrimination. My solution to this problem was to make a website that will break down the stereotypes and educate people about ethnic groups. I chose to make a website because of my interest in web page development and programming.
