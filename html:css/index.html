	<h2 class = "subheading" color: "white">What is the difference between race and ethnicity?</h2>
	<p> Nowadays, race and ethnicity are used almost synonymously. But there is a key difference between the two:
	 Race is associated with biology, while ethnicity is associated with culture. <br><br>
	 
	All humans belong to the same species (Homo sapiens), but there are <em>small genetic variations</em>
	that lead to <strong>diverse physical appearances</strong>. Although these small genetic variations may make
	significant changes to outwardly appearance, scientists have found that the DNA of two random individuals 
	genetically varies by less than <strong>0.1 percent</strong>, which makes a strong case that all humans belong
	to one race: the human race.<br><br>
	
	Ethnicity varies in quite a few ways from race. It is the term for the culture of people in a geographic region, including
	language, heritage, religion, and customs. In order to be a member of that ethnic group, it is necessary to conform to
	one or all of these practices.<br><br>
	
	Race and ethnicity can obviously overlap. An example would be a Japanese-American who considers herself a member
	of the Japanese or East-Asian race, but might consider her an American, and not with her ethnicity, because she 
	does engage in any of her ancestor's customs.<br>
	</p>
	
	<h2 class ="subheading" color: "white"> So what is racism?</h2>
	
	<p class="quote"> "Racism is the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another, that a personâ€™s social 
	and moral traits are predetermined by his or her inborn biological characteristics. Racial separatism is the belief, 
	most of the time based on racism, that different races should remain segregated and apart from one another."<br>

	<h2 class = "subheading" color: "white"> Interesting Fact of the Day</h2>
	
	<em> This section will feature an interesting fact about a race/ethnic group everyday.</em>
	
	<p> Today we are featuring Chile. The national flag and the national anthem are important symbols in the national identity
	 of the Chilean people. On the flag, there are two horizontal stripes: the white representing the Andean snow and the red 
	 representing the fallen bloods of the Indians in their heroic struggle against the Spanish invaders. The blue square 
	 represents Chile's clear blue sky while the white star was the Araucanian Indians coat of arms used in their battlefield
	 banners.</p>
