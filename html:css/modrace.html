	<h3> Racial Tensions Grow at University of Kansas</h3>
	<p><em> A section that elaborates on recent events</em></p>
	<p> At the University of Kansas, there has been growing racial tensions, which has led to a
	call for three student Senate leaders to step down. The Senate's Student Executive Committee
	registered a 6 to 3 "no-confidence" vote for the three leaders on Friday. What is a "no-confidence"
	vote? It is a vote that finds that someone is not fit to hold their position, due to various reasons.
	The three leaders: the student body president, vice president, and chief staff, have been demanded by the committee
	to resign or face imminent impeachment.<br><br>

	This resignation demand stems from weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri, with protests
	that started after a series of racist events that students said administrators were not taking seriously. 
	These protests eventually lead to the resignation of University of Missouri President Tim Wolfe.
	A forum was also moderated at KU where the student group Rock Chalk Invisible Hawk presented diversity demands.
	Some of the demands include increased diversity in hiring and "inclusion and belonging" training for students
	and faculty.<br><br>
	
	A 2014 KU graduate also came back to support the cause. He began a campus strike in solidarity 
	with KU student groups.</p>
