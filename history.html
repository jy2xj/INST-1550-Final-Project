	<p> The first signs of a racist view of the world could have appeared during the 13th
	and 14th centuries with the identification of the jews with the devil and witchcraft in
	the popular mind of the time. During the 16th century was when Jews who had converted to 
	Christianity became the victims of a pattern of discrimination and exclusion. <br><br>
	
	<p> During the Renaissance and Reformation periods was when Europeans came into greater 
	contact with people of darker skin color. The original justification for enslaving 
	Africans was that they were heathens. But in 1667, when Virginia decreed that converted
	slaves could be kept in bondage for heathen ancestry and not because they were actual 
	heathens, the reason for slavery was changed from religious status to something approaching 
	race.</p>
